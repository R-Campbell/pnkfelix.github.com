<h1>
Objects, OOP
</h1>

<p>
Object oriented programming (OOP) gets a lot of hype.
This lecture explores what OOP is, why it generates so
much excitement, where it works well, and where it does not.
</p>

<h3>What are Objects?  What is Object Oriented Programming?</h3>

<p>
Practitioners associate the term Object Oriented Programming 
with a wide variety of concepts.
Part of the reason that OOP gets so much hype is that
some developers think that you <em>need</em> object-oriented 
programming to reap certain benefits.
Here are some concepts associated with OOP:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Encapsulation</dt>
<dd>Cluster procedures with the data that they process, and 
  <em>ensure</em> that <em>only</em> procedures in the cluster 
  have access to the data.
</dd>
<dt>Dispatch</dt>
<dd>Tie a group of procedures up into a bundle 
  (potentially with the data that the procedures process as well), 
  and pass around this bundle as a first class value.
  The bundle of procedures should adhere to some well-defined
  <em>interface</em>; then client code can invoke 
  the procedures by treating them as black-box implementations 
  of the interface, and developers are free to add new variant
  implementations, as long as the variants adhere to the specification.
  (Related term: <em>Message Passing</em>)
</dd>
<dt>Delegation</dt>
<dd>This is an extension of dispatch: in addition to tying the procedures
  into a bundle, every procedure in the bundle adheres to a protocol 
  where the bundle is itself passed as an argument.
  The particular formal parameter that corresponds to the bundle is
  often referred to as the <em>self</em> or <em>this</em> parameter
  (and is often associated with special syntax in an Object Oriented 
  programming language, e.g. <code>this</code> in Java or C#).
  Then each procedure definition can choose whether it is appropriate to 
  use methods from the bundle to accomplish subtasks.
</dd>
<dt>Hierarchical Design, Take 1: Implementation Inheritance</dt>
<dd>Explicitly name the classes of data (within the language, not in comments).
  Relate the classes according to an explicitly indicated <em>subclass</em> 
  relationship.
  Group common code patterns high in the class hierarchy tree, 
  delegating to another method where appropriate.
  (Related term: <em>Subclassing</em>)
</dd>
<dt>Hierarchical Design, Take 2: Type Inheritance</dt>
<dd>Explicitly name the classes of data (within the language, not in comments).
  Relate the classes according to a subtype relation.
  Clients write their code to the interface of classes high in the tree, so that
  it can be used with all of the classes that conform to that interface.
  (Related term: <em>Subtyping</em>)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I will try address all of the ideas above during this lecture.

and perspective) at the start of

<hr/>

<p>
Lets set the stage by reviewing our usual
development methodology: "Applicative Programming"; then 
I will discuss how that contrasts with development in an 
object-oriented language.
</p>

<h3>Applicative Programming (see also Functional Programming)</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fixed data representation, potentially with invariants and
  an <em>interpretation</em>.
</li>
<li>A set of functions that manipulate the data.
  Developers are free to extend this set by defining new functions.
  The structure of these functions can often "follow the grammar" 
  used to define the data.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An applicative programming style has two main stages: 
we first determine what the data definition is, and then we
write functions that manipulate that data.
</p>

<p>
This strategy makes sense for a class on programming languages,
where most functions process abstract-syntax trees for a particular language: 
interpreters, type-checkers, and various program transformers.
Often programming language developers will be working with a fixed
grammar for the language in question; the language is fixed, but the
set of operations we want to perform on terms in the language 
is growing over time.
</p>

<p>
Note that this strategy makes it difficult to change the data
definitions later; every change to the data definition may require
review of all the functions that process instances of that data.
</p>

<h3>Data Abstraction</h3>

<p>
A data type consists of two parts:
</p>
<ul class="darker">
<li>interface</li>
<li>implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>
For an <em>abstract data type</em>, the interface consists
of a set of operations that clients are allowed to use when
manipulating values of the abstract data type.
With abstract data types, clients do not need to know how
the data is represented.  That means the representation can
be changed without breaking any client code.
In other words, client code is <em>representation-independent</em>.
</p>

<h3>A concrete example: a Queue abstraction</h3>

<p>
A <em>queue</em> represents a sequence of values that 
are delivered in "first-in first-out" (FIFO) order;
the first element enqueued will be the first element 
removed, the second element enqueued will be the second
element removed, and so on.
</p>

<p>
We will write a sequence of values mathematically
using the notation 
<span class="nobr"><code>[</code><em>a, b, c, &hellip;, x, y, z</em><code>]</code></span>; 
thus we will denote an implementation's
<em>representation</em> of such a sequence
using the notation
<span class="nobr">&#x2308;<code>[</code><em>a, b, c, &hellip;, x, y, z</em><code>]</code>&#x2309;</span>.
(Note that the ellipses notation is somewhat informal;
one important detail is that 
we use <code>[</code><em>a, &hellip;, k</em><code>]</code> to denote a
<em>potentially empty</em> sequence,
but <code>[</code><em>a, b, &hellip;, k</em><code>]</code> 
and <code>[</code><em>a, &hellip;, k, l</em><code>]</code> 
both denote non-empty sequences.)
</p>

<blockquote class="darker">
<code>empty   : &rarr; Queue</code> <br/>
<code>snoc    : Queue &times; Val &rarr; Queue</code> <br/>
<code>isEmpty : Queue &rarr; Boolean</code> <br/>
<code>head    : Queue &rarr; Val</code> <br/>
<code>tail    : Queue &rarr; Queue</code> <br/>
<br/>
<code>(empty)</code> = &#x2308; <code>[]</code>  &#x2309; <br/>
<br/>
<code>
(snoc </code> 
 &#x2308;<code>[</code><em>a, &hellip;, w</em><code>]</code>&#x2309; 
 x<code>)</code> 
= &#x2308; <code>[</code><em>a, &hellip;, w, x</em><code>]</code>  &#x2309; <br/>
<br/>
<code>(isEmpty </code> &#x2308;<code>[]</code>&#x2309;<code>)</code> = <code>#t</code> <br/>
<br/>
<code>(isEmpty </code> &#x2308;<code>[</code><em>a, b, &hellip;, w</em><code>]</code>&#x2309;<code>)</code> = <code>#f</code> <br/>
<br/>
<code>(head </code> &#x2308;<code>[</code><em>a, b, &hellip;, w</em><code>]</code>&#x2309;<code>)</code> = <em>a</em> <br/>

<h4>First applicative queue implementation</h4>

<p>
Here is a one queue implementation: 
<a href="queue1.sls.html">queue1 ("simple")</a>.
What are its features?  What are its drawbacks?
</p>

<p>Features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Every sequence has a uniquely defined representation.</li>
<li>Implementation is very simple; "obviously correct."</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks: </p>
<ul>
<li>Slow!  Every <code>snoc</code> takes O(n) time!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Second applicative queue implementation</h4>

<p>
Here is another queue implementation: 
<a href="queue2.sls.html">queue2 ("fast")</a>.
What are its features?  What are its drawbacks?
</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation is still reasonably simple<br/>
  (note however that some sequences are not uniquely represented).</li>
<li>Worst case O(1) time for <code>snoc</code> and <code>head</code>.</li>
<li>Amortized O(1) time for all operations, <em>if</em> the queue is used <em>linearly</em> 
  (in <a href="http://www.eecs.usma.edu/webs/people/okasaki/pubs.html">Okasaki</a>'s terms, 
   the O(1) bound holds only if the queue is used <em>ephemerally</em>, 
   in a single-threaded fashion).
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worst-case O(<em>n</em>) time for <code>tail</code>.</li>
<li>
  If the queue is used 
  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistently</a></em>, 
  where we can continue to
  refer to old queues even after dequeuing elements
  via <code>tail</code>, then this queue representation does <em>not</em> have
  amortized O(1) time for all operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Taking a step back</h4>

<p>There do exist (even more complex) queue implementations
  that can achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  amortized O(1) time for all operations, even when the queue is used persistently, or
</li>
<li>
  worst-case O(1) time for all operations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>But, should the client care how queues are implemented? 
  <!-- Note that the right answer here is "maybe..." -->
</p>
<p>
  Can we write our client in a manner so that it does not care
  how queues are implemented?
  (See for example 
   <a href="queue-tests.sps.html">these <em>black-box</em> queue tests</a>.)
</p>

<p>(We can edit the first <code>import</code> of the script
    to change which queue implementation we want to use in the
    test program.)</p>

<p>Here is the output from that test suite on the first and 
second queue implementations (after installing them as libraries).</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-tests.sps
success
success
success
success
success
success
</pre>

<h2>Encapsulating a Queue implementation</h2>

<p>I have structured the code above in a manner such that 
I can run the tests importing either queue implementation.</p>

<p>However, I took special care when writing 
my <em>test suite</em> code to make sure that it 
never attempted to look at the internal representation of 
queues.
</p>

<p>Here is another 
<a href="queue-tests-rep-exposed.sps.html">("white-box") test suite</a> 
that was not written to the abstract specification.
In particular, it assumes that queues have been implemented 
using the <a href="queue1.sls.html">first representation</a>.
Compare: a run using the first implementation:
</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-tests-rep-exposed.sps
success
success
success
success
success
success
</pre>

<p>but if we edit the testing script to use the second implementation,
by changing the import to start with:
<br/>
<code>(import (obj-lecture queue1-encapsulated) ...)</code>:</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-tests-rep-exposed.sps
FAILURE (empty)
   should be: ()
     but got: (() ())
FAILURE (snoc (empty) 'a)
   should be: (a)
     but got: ((a) ())
success
FAILURE (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b)
   should be: (a b)
     but got: ((a) (b))
FAILURE (tail (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b))
   should be: (b)
     but got: ((b) ())
FAILURE (tail (tail (tail (snoc (snoc (snoc (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b) 'c) 'd) 'e))))
   should be: (d e)
     but got: ((d e) ())
</pre>

<p>Note that these failures are not particularly illuminating;
it is not obvious from the failure messages
why the actual and expected values do not match.</p>

<p>The problem is that the client (in this case, the test suite) 
has <em>violated</em> the Queue abstraction; it has relied on the particular
representation used for queues, but a proper client should only 
interact with the data by using the appropriate procedures defined
in the abstraction.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
One can <em>enforce</em> an abstraction by properly modularizing 
the code.  Most modern languages provide facilities for defining
modules as collections of related procedures, and rules for
what procedures have access to the internal representation of 
an abstraction.
</p>

<p>
Here is a revision, 
<a href="queue1-encapsulated.sls.html">queue1 (encapsulated)</a>, 
of the first (slow but simple) queue implementation
that illustrates one way to control access to a representation, 
and thus enforces modularity.
</p>
<p>This is only meant to illustrate
one way to achieve this effect; as stated above, most modern languages
provide more convenient facilities for defining access rules.
</p>

<p>If we now change our script to import the encapsulated library:</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-tests.sps
success
success
success
success
success
success
% plt-r6rs queue-tests-rep-exposed.sps
FAILURE (empty)
   should be: ()
     but got: #&lt;procedure:an-abstract-queue&gt;
FAILURE (snoc (empty) 'a)
   should be: (a)
     but got: #&lt;procedure:an-abstract-queue&gt;
success
FAILURE (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b)
   should be: (a b)
     but got: #&lt;procedure:an-abstract-queue&gt;
FAILURE (tail (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b))
   should be: (b)
     but got: #&lt;procedure:an-abstract-queue&gt;
FAILURE (tail (tail (tail (snoc (snoc (snoc (snoc (snoc (empty) 'a) 'b) 'c) 'd) 'e))))
   should be: (d e)
     but got: #&lt;procedure:an-abstract-queue&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Now the failure messages are a bit clearer: the tests are failing because
the client (the test writer) wrote down that the code expected values such as 
the list <code>(a)</code>
but the actual values we receive are abstract queues.
</p>

<p>
Even if the client wanted to break the abstraction by trying to
apply the returned procedure, they would be foiled (illustrated
below).

</pre>

<p>This <em>encapsulation</em> of the internal representation, exposing
only operations that know how to properly manipulate the data and 
preserve invariants of the representation, is often considered a 
key benefit of object-oriented programming.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, with a sufficiently expressive language, 
the most common attempts to violate encapsulation
can be detected <em>statically</em>; the program
can be rejected before you run it.  (The technique
illustrated above is detecting the encapsulation
violation <em>dynamically</em>, so the system
does not signal an error until 
we run the code for the 
<a href="queue-tests-rep-exposed.sps.html">white-box test suite</a> 
that violates the encapsulation.)
</p>
<p>However, encapsulation is <em>not</em>
a benefit that is provided by only object-oriented languages.
Many non-object-oriented languages do support modular 
program definitions where representations are hidden;
after all, I just demonstrated one way to accomplish the task
in Scheme!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, you can write
code in Java or C# where the internal representation is 
exposed as a set of <code>public</code> fields; it is up 
to the programmer to decide how to use the features of the 
language to achieve their desired system design.
</p>
<p>
Still, many practitioners will list <em>encapsulation</em> as a reason
that they use object-oriented languages for their systems development.
</p>

<h2>Dispatch in a Queue implementation</h2>

<p>
In the above demonstrations, I chose between the
<a href="queue1.sls.html">queue1 ("simple")</a>, 
<a href="queue2.sls.html">queue2 ("fast")</a>, and
<a href="queue1-encapsulated.sls.html">queue1 ("encapsulated")</a>
implementations; it is
not legal with the code above to mix-and-match queue implementations.
</p>
<p>
That is, the client code can be ignorant of which queue abstraction it
is using, but it still needs to be linked against a <em>single</em> 
queue implementation, or else there are likely to be serious consequences.
</p>
<p>
We can see some of the bad effects of trying to link against several
of the above queue implementations with this script, 
<a href="queue-mixing.sps.html">queue-mixing.sps</a>.
</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-mixing.sps
B? b
mcar: expects argument of type &lt;mutable-pair&gt;; given a
A? 
</pre>

<p>Maybe that's a PLT bug; let's try Larceny.</p>
<pre>
% larceny -path .. -r6rs -program queue-mixing.sps
B? b
A? 
Error: no handler for exception #&lt;record &amp;compound-condition&gt;
Compound condition has these components: 
#&lt;record &amp;assertion&gt;
#&lt;record &amp;who&gt;
    who : "car"
#&lt;record &amp;message&gt;
    message : " a is not a pair.\n"

Terminating program execution.
</pre>

<p>No, Larceny agrees with PLT Scheme on this point.</p>

<p>Something is definitely wrong with how 
<a href="queue-mixing.sps.html">queue-mixing.sps</a>
attempts to use the queues.</p>
<blockquote>You can see other "fun" results if you avoid the runtime
error by commenting out the three lines grouped with the
<span class="nobr"><code>(display "A? ")</code></span> expression and try 
running the script again.</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>
If you want to be able to use different implementations of the same interface
at the same time, you need a more sophisticated way of mapping 
the operations you want to perform with the actual code that performs 
those operations.
</p>

<p>By representing our data in a different way, we can interact with 
it by passing a <em>message</em> asking it to perform a particular 
operation.</p>
<p>Here are translations of
the first, <a href="queue1-dispatch.sls.html">queue1 ("dispatch")</a>, and 
second, <a href="queue2-dispatch.sls.html">queue2 ("dispatch")</a>, 
implementations
into a message-passing style.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As a quick aside: the R<sup>6</sup>RS library system actually helped my presentation
here, since I was able to layer the dispatching implementations on top
of the core implementations of <code>queue1</code> and <code>queue2</code>.
</p>
<p>When I gave this lecture previously, I 
based the code on R<sup>5</sup>RS Scheme;
but the R<sup>5</sup>RS does not provide a library system.
So I had to choose between using 
<code>load</code> + <code>define</code> tricks to get the above
effect, or 
copying the implementations of <code>queue1</code> 
and <code>queue2</code> into the dispatching implementations.</p>
<p>In that presentation, I chose to copy the implementations, 
but that meant that
the details of the individual queue implementations were distracting
the reader of the code from the core ideas of dispatch.  In this 
version, the <code>library</code> system lets me focus on the
relevant details to dispatch alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now we can load one version, use it, load another version, use that as
well, and the values we constructing with the first version continue 
to work, as in this <a href="queue-mixing-dispatch.sps.html">script</a>:
</p>
<pre>
% plt-r6rs queue-mixing-dispatch.sps
B? b
A? a
Y? y
X? x
</pre>

<p>The code
for <a href="queue1-dispatch.sls.html">queue1-dispatch</a> and 
<a href="queue2-dispatch.sls.html">queue2-dispatch</a>
 illustrates <em>dynamic dispatch</em> 
(or sometimes <em>single dispatch</em>,
 or sometimes just <em>dispatch</em>).
</p>
<p>
Dispatch can provide a strong separation between
interface and implementation, because one typically
defines the interface when one is developing the 
set of messages that will be passed around.
The actual code that implements the desired behavior
associated with the messages can be developed 
long after the interface has been conceived.
</p>
<p>
But there is a piece missing, and understanding 
<em>what</em> the missing piece is requires that we 
take another step back.
</p>

<h2>Queues in a larger context: classes and classifications</h2>

<p>
A queue abstraction can be useful for 
certain algorithms that require a FIFO order
on element delivery and <em>do not</em> require
any other sort of order of fast access to enqueued
elements.
</p>

<p>
But some clients may not require a strict FIFO order;
some clients will be happy to consume an 
element from anywhere in the queue.
</p>

<p>
And other clients may require fast access to both
the most-recently inserted <em>and</em> least-recently 
inserted elements.
</p>

<p>
It would be useful to categorize our implementations according
to what capabilities they have; that is, what operations they
can support.  If we were to classify our various interfaces 
into a hierarchy, then our clients could clearly state their 
requirements by choosing the interface appropriate to their
needs.
</p>

<p>
For my examples in this lecture, I will use a simple
hierarchy.  Here is its interface (not implementation):
</p>
<pre>
Collection supports methods
  isEmpty : Collection -> Bool
  addElem : Collection * Value -> Collection
  anyElem : Collection -> (list Value Collection) ;; only non-empty works!
  addAll  : Collection * Collection -> Collection
  toList  : Collection -> Listof[Value]

Queue extends Collection and adds methods
  snoc    : Queue * Value -> Queue
  head    : Queue -> Value                        ;; only non-empty works!
  tail    : Queue -> Queue                        ;; only non-empty works!

Tree extends Collection and adds methods
  isLeaf    : Tree -> Bool
  nodeValue : Tree -> Value                       ;; only non-leaf works!
  left      : Tree -> Tree                        ;; only non-leaf works!
  right     : Tree -> Tree                        ;; only non-leaf works!

The base Queue constructor is 
  empty : -> Queue

The base Tree constructors are
  leaf  : -> Tree
  node  : Tree * Tree * Value -> Tree
</pre>

<h2>Implementation Inheritance</h2>

<p>
There may be a lot of potential code sharing amongst the different
implementations.  A <code>Collection</code> class might implement
a method, <code>addAll</code>, where one collection <em>c1</em> 
consumes another collection <em>c2</em>
of elements and produces the union of the two by iteratively 
invoking the <em>c1</em><code>.add</code> method on each element
it can get out of <em>c2</em>.
</p>

<p>
This is a common code pattern that we would like to put into one place,
into the <code>Collection</code> class.  Extensions of the 
<code>Collection</code> will be responsible for properly implementing
its <code>add</code> method, but once that is in place, then
all of the extensions immediately support the <code>addAll</code>
method.  (At least in principle; there are caveats here.)
</p>

<h3>Delegation in a Queue implementation</h3>

<p>
The crucial idea to support implementation inheritance: pass
your<em>self</em> around as another parameter!
Then, when you need to invoke a method, pass a message 
<em>to yourself</em>!
</p>
<p>
(This may sound absurd; why would this accomplish anything?)
</p>
<p>
This is the heart of delegation; pass a special <em>self</em> parameter
around; for any method that you want to allow your subclasses
to handle in their implementation, you perform the invocation
by passing a message to <em>self</em>.
</p>

<p>
(Felix finds it fascinating that this notion of <em>self-reference</em>,
the key to delegation, is also the key for implementing recursive
functions in languages like PROC.  But that is just an aside.)
</p>

<h3>Scheme code illustrating Delegation</h3>

<p>Here is the relevant code that illustrates delegation,
using Scheme as the implementation language so that the
<em>self</em> parameter is explicit in the code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="collection-delegate.sls.html">collection ("delegate")</a>
</li>
<li><a href="queue1-delegate.sls.html">queue1 ("delegate")</a>
</li>
<li><a href="tree-delegate.sls.html">tree ("delegate")</a>
</li>
</ul>

And here is a 
<a href="demo-delegation.sps.html">script</a> that demonstrates it:
<pre>
% plt-r6rs  demo-delegation.sps
{}:                 ()
{a b c}:            (a b c)
{b c}:              (b c)
{}:                 ()

<h3>Java code illustrating Delegation</h3>

<p>And <em>here</em> is the big punch-line: the above bits of Scheme code, but encoded 
as Java classes! (plus a <code>Main</code> program that tests them).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Collection.java.html">Collection.java</a>
</li>
<li><a href="Queue.java.html">Queue.java</a>
</li>
<li><a href="Tree.java.html">Tree.java</a>
</li>
<li><a href="Main.java.html">Main.java</a>
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
% javac Collection.java Queue.java Tree.java Main.java
% java Main
> q1.toString():
( )
> q2.toString():
( a b c )
> q2.tail().toString():
( b c )
> t1.toString():
( )
> t2.toString():
( p t q s r )
> t2.isLeaf():
false
> t2.right().isLeaf():
false
> t2.left().isLeaf():
false
> t2.left().nodeValue():
p
> t2.right().toString():
( q s r )
> q2.addAll(t2).toString():
( a b c p t q s r )
</pre>

<p>(Does the output of <code>Main</code> look familiar?)</p>

<h2>Type Inheritance</h2>

<h3>Subclassing versus Subtyping.</h3>

<h4>When subclassing is not subtyping, part 1: a contrived example.</h4>

<pre>
class A {
  /* specification of four: must always return 4. */
  public int four() { return 4; }
  /* specification of five: must always return 5. */
  public int five() { return 5; }
}

class B {
  public int four() { return five() + 2; }
}
</pre>
<p>
Above is <em>subclassing</em> 
(since we are inheriting the implementation 
of the <code>five()</code> method and
using it within the definition of the <code>B</code> class)
but it is not <em>subtyping</em>.
</p>

<h4>When subclassing is not subtyping, part 2: a real-world example.</h4>

<p>
Consider the <code>Object.equals</code> 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)">method</a> 
in Java.
</p>

<p>
In particular, consider the constraint that specfication
puts on its subclasses with respect to whether they 
need to implement the 
<code>Object.hashCode</code>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()">method</a>.
</p>

<p>Is this class, <code>C</code>, a subtype of <code>Object</code>?</p>
<pre>
class C { 
  int hashCode() { return 42; }
}
</pre>

<p>How about <code>D</code>?</p>
<pre>
class D {
  boolean equals(Object d) { return (d instanceof D); }
}
</pre>
