My thesis: Regional garbage collection with summarization, waveoff,
and snapshot refinement, provides mutator-independent worst-case
bounds on pause times and minimum mutator utilization, and provides
competitive throughput while maintaining a worst-case bound on overall

<p>
<em>Regional garbage collection</em>
offers a useful compromise between real-time
and generational collection. Regional collectors resemble generational collectors,
but are scalable. A scalable collector guarantees a positive lower
bound, independent of mutator and live storage, for the theoretical worstcase
minimum mutator utilization (MMU).
</p>
<p>
Standard generational collectors are not scalable. Some real-time collectors
are scalable, while others assume a well-behaved mutator or provide no
worst-case guarantees at all.
</p>
<p>
This dissertation presents regional garbage collection, coupled with a
theorem establishing that it is scalable in the sense above, as well as establishing
upper bounds for its worst-case space usage and collection pauses.
</p>
<p>
Regional collectors separate <em>summarization</em> and 
<em>refinement</em> from the task
of object reclamation. They resolve “popularity” problems via two novel
technologies: <em>summarization wave-off</em>, and <em>region fame</em>.
Regional collectors cannot compete with hard real-time collectors at millisecond
resolutions, but offer efficiency comparable to contemporary generational
collectors combined with improved latency and MMU at resolutions
on the order of hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
A prototype regional collector performs acceptably on a wide range of
benchmarks: It is comparable to a tuned generational collector on a set
of fifty-eight non-collection-intensive benchmarks, and achieves acceptable
throughput without violating its bounds on a set of thirteen collection-intensive
benchmarks.
