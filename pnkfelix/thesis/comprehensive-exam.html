<h2>The Committee</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/">Will Clinger</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/">Gene Cooperman</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/">Olin Shivers</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?c=476">Guy Steele</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Will Clinger wrote the following paragraph to explain the choice of committee:
</p>
<blockquote>
Felix's thesis concerns the design and implementation
of a generational garbage collector with provable
worst-case bounds on several important aspects of
performance combined with reasonable throughput on
typical programs.  All members of his committee are
comfortable with algorithm design and analysis and
with low-level systems implementation, including
concurrency on shared-memory multiprocessors.  Guy
Steele, who was on the program committee for ISMM
2008, understands the industrial state of this art.
Gene Cooperman and Olin Shivers understand garbage
collection in general and systems implementation.

<h2>The Proposal</h2>
<p>
The thesis proposal: <a href="rrof-thesis-proposal.pdf">Regional Garbage Collection</a>
</p>

The short version:
<p>
Garbage collectors that 
occasionally pause to collect the entire heap 
work well enough for many applications, 
but that paradigm does not scale up because 
collection pauses that take time
proportional to the total heap size
can cause alarming or annoying delays, 
even if they occur rarely.
</p>
<p>
Real-time, incremental, and concurrent collectors 
eliminate such delays but introduce complex 
invariants to the memory management system.
Maintenance of these invariants 
during execution reduces application throughput.
Also, supporting these invariants increases 
the complexity of compilers, run-time infrastructure, 
and low-level libraries 
(e.g. client modules written in C and 
 linked via a foreign function interface).
</p>
<p>
In non-real-time operating environments, 
real-time garbage collection is overkill.
It would be better to preserve the throughput of generational collectors 
while eliminating the long delays associated with major collections.
Implementors would also appreciate a 
system with hard bounds on pause times, 
but simpler than contemporary real-time memory managers.
</p>
<p>
Will Clinger (my thesis advisor) 
and I have designed, and I am implementing, 
a <em>regional garbage collector</em>
that collects bounded subsets of the heap
during <em>every</em> collection, thus 
disentangling the worst-case mutator pause time 
from the total heap size.
The design isolates 
collection-related work 
not directly associated with moving objects; 
a separate processor core can perform such work
without direct interaction with the mutator thread.
</p>
<p>
My thesis is: 
Our regional garbage collector 
achieves worst case bounds on mutator pause times
and minimum mutator utilization, 
and if its concurrent tasks are run with sufficiently high 
priority, it provides competitive throughput while 
maintaining a worst case bound on overall memory usage.
