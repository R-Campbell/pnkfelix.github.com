pnkfelix.github.com
===================

user repository.  intention is mainly to serve as a central point to link to other pages (or repos) of interest to me as a developer

You can go to [Felix's home page](pnkfelix/index.html).

There are also [Felix's presentations](presentations/index.html), and [his blog](http://blog.pnkfx.org/).

The source code for the core of the site is in one [github repo](https://github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfelix.github.com),
but some sub-sites are stored in other repos:

 * [presentations](https://github.com/pnkfelix/presentations/)
 * [blog](https://github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfx-blog/)

There are also some ancient [links](links.html).
